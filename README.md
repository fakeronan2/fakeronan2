Hey, I am fakeronan2 a Roblox developer with basic skills in building and scripting.

I have basic knowledge of Lua.

Free and open source components is at the core of some of my projects, I even make some of my old projects free and open source so that people can learn from it, and possiably continue it.

I like linux, but I don't use it as my main operating system.
I prefer Arch Linux, because alpine is limited by not having glibc.
I don't like Fedora as it is made by Redhat, another company that wants to commerize Linux distros to try to discourage people from using community projects like Debian, Void Linux and Arch Linux. I also feel the same way about Ubuntu, due to Canonical. Debian is as easy to install as Ubuntu, while protecting the users freedom.
