Hey, I am fakeronan2 a Roblox developer with basic skills in building and scripting.

I have basic knowledge of Lua.

Opensource is at the core of some of my projects, I even opensource some of my old projects so that people can learn from it.

I like linux, but I don't use it as my main operating system.
